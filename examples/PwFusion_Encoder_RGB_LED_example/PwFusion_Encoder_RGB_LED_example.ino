* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to initialize and run a Playing With Fusion R3aktor in
* order to communicate with the I2C Encoder board. Funcionality is as described below:
*	- Configure R3aktor to alter the brightness of an RGB LED based on the input from
*   the rotary encoder
*       - call PWF library to configure and read the I2C Rotary Encoder inputs
*	- Broadcast results to COM port
*  Circuit:
*    R3aktor     -->  RGB LED
*    DIO pin 09  -->  Red Pin with 220 ohm resistor in series
*    DIO pin 10  -->  Green Pin with 220 ohm resistor in series
*    DIO pin 11  -->  Blue Pin with 220 ohm in resistor series
*    GND         -->  GND
*    R3aktor     -->  I2C Encoder
*    Qwiic pins  -->  Qwiic pins
